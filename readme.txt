CONCEPT
_________________________________________
Where the Grass is Greener is a web application that encourages users to passively connect with their friends while they work, game, or casually browse the internet. This is done through the use of avatars, which in this case are the great exploratory species of Membles (a cat / bear hybrid.) 
 
Users will be able to establish an ever-growing homestead, inviting their friends over to either help them build up the homestead or simply just hang out. As the homestead grows, more hang-out options will become available.
